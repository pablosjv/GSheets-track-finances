# GSheets-track-finances

Connect your bank account to Google Sheets.
Track your finances with ease.

## What is it?

This tool allows you to connect your bank account to Google Sheets without any programming skills. You can use it to fetch your banking data and analyse it using some pre-built functionality. There are many great budgeting apps out there, but let's be fair - a spreadsheet is a spreadsheet.

This tool was built by [Nordigen](https://nordigen.com/) as a hobby project and it uses our open banking data API. Nordigen is a freemium open banking platform - we're a [licensed Account Information Service provider](https://www.fktk.lv/en/market/payment-service-providers/third-party-service-providers/ltd-nordigen-solutions/) authorised to connect to bank accounts in 31 European countries.

Before you start, please read Nordigen's [Terms and Conditions](https://nordigen.com/en/company/terms-and-conditions-end-user/) and [Privacy Policy](https://nordigen.com/en/company/privacy-policy-end-user/) to understand how we handle your data. Also, please read Google Drive [Terms of Service](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2450387?hl=en) as you will be storing your data in Google Sheets.
